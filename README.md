# Simple task manager app using NestJS and TypeScript

This application provides a RESTful API where users can authenticate themselves and with valid authentication and authorisation can create, read, update and delete tasks.

This project has helped me use best practices when developing server-side applications while
also using a framework that combines elements of OOP & FP, and focuses on a code structure that is
scalable, testable, loosely coupled and maintainable. These practices include e.g. environment
configuration, logging, data persistence layer, error handling, and unit testing.
